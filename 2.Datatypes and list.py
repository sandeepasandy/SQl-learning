'''Datatypes: To find datatype we should use this syntax type(variable_name)
To find memory id(variable_name)
Integer:
integer nothing but numbers
number=9
Can perform arithmetic operations
Float:
num=89.45
print(type(num))
String:
    string is a sequence of characters that are enclosed in (' ',"",''',''')
    the characters given in those quotes then it is called as string
    string is immutable
    so='python is a language'
    for j in so:
        print (j)
Method:
    Replace():Used to replace old string with new string
    syntax:variable_name.replace('old_str','new_str','how many')
    how many is an optional

so='python is a language python python'
print(so.replace('python','java'))

    Join():This method will add new char after every substring
    Syntax:'new_string'.join(variable_name)
so='python is a language'
print('-'.join(so))

    Split():
so='python is a language'
print(so.split('is'))
    Index():gets the position value
so='python is a language'
print(so.index('a'))
    Count:counts the variable place
so='python is a language'
print(so.count('n'10,16))
   Indexing:will give what we give to find a index integer
so='python is a language'
print(so[12])

  List:
      list is a collection of different datatypes that are represented
      in square brackets and separated by ,
      list is a muttable datatype
any_=[1,'python',[2,['python',9],4],'java',['python',[56,78],'java',90]]
print(any_[4])
 Append:
 Append method is used to add new item into the list and it will add at
last index position
any_=[1,2,3,4,5]
any_.append([10])
print(any_)

Extend:
any_=[1,2,3,4,5]
any_.append("python")
print(any_)
any_.extend("python")
print(any_)

Remove:
remove will delete the item based on the value given
if the value not the list will the error
any_=[1,2,3,4,5,2]
any_.remove(2)
print(any_)

Pop:
the pop will delete the item based on the index position given
if the index position is out of  range in the list will the error
any_=[1,2,3,4,5]
any_.pop(2)
print(any_)'''
